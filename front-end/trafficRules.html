			<h3>Give sign</h3>

			<h3>Bicycle path</h3>

			<p class="change">You can park your bicycle almost everywhere. But look out for parking signs, they might tell you that it is forbidden to park right there.</p>
			<h3>A duty to give way</h3>
			<p class="change">In situations where you come from a bicycle path to a road, you are supposed to give way for cars. Slow down and look out for cars. When there are no cars, you can continue your way.</p>
			<h3>Cycle passage</h3>
			<p class="change">In some cases, there are cycle passages which are made for crossing the roads by bicycle. Sometimes, there are traffic lights which controls traffic. If there are not, you should have contact with the car drivers.
			You are not guilty to stop and give way for the car, but neither are they. You should read the situation and see who is likely to drive first. Always slow down near cycle passages. Many cars do not look out for cyclists.</p>
